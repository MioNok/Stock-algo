# Stock-analysis
**Ongoing project** where I use different APIs to collect, store and analyze US stock market data. With this data I have built an algrithm that will buy/ sell stocks according to a single or a set of strategies. 

Stock data, past/active trades and watchlistst will be stored in a cloud SQL database. The plan is to build a front-end using flask or just a google data studio for example, yet to be decided. 

I also plan to back test these trading strategies and then build MLPs to further evaluate each trades chance of success using several technical indicators. This will also be used to manage the risk of the porfolio.
